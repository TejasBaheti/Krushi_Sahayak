Why is protection of plant varieties required in India ?>, India is one of the founder members of World Trade Organization (WTO) which was established through an agreement known as Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization that was negotiated and signed by the bulk of the world’s trading nations at Marrakesh, Morocco in 1995, These documents provide the legal ground-rules for international commerce to which all member nations are committed in their trade practices, The TRIPS Agreement is one of the many agreements among these documents, which is Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement, The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is an international legal agreement between all the member nations of the WTO, The TRIPS Agreement is a minimum standards agreement, which allows Members to provide more extensive protection of intellectual property if they so wish, For India, the TRIPs agreement became binding from 2005 onwards as the country has got a ten-year transition period (1995-2005) to make the domestic legislation compatible with TRIPs, TRIPS Agreement required India to make necessary provisions for the protection of plant varieties and the rights of plant breeders, In compliance, the Government of India chose the option to adopt an effective sui generis system to protect the plant breeders’ rights on plant varieties along with the rights of farmers’ of the country on the plant varieties through an Act of the Parliament of India by passing the bill on “Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Act 2001” or PPVFRA (2001), The Rules were framed in 2003, and the Authority was established on November 11," 2005. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is the meaning of protection of plant varieties ?>, The protection on the variety means no one can sell, export, import or produce the seed or propagating materials of such protected (registered) plant variety without the registered breeder’s (owner’s) permission, Protection of a plant variety is an intellectual property right that the breeder (who could be an individual, farmer, community of farmers, institution or a government) enjoys over the variety along with its denomination as its owner who is entitled to rights on the variety that shall remain with the breeder till he assigns it to anyone else, for the entire period of protection for the purpose of preventing any other person from making economic benefit from it or from assuming any of the rights to which the breeder is entitled to without the permission of the breeder in whose name the variety is registered, The protection of the plant variety also means that no one including the registered breeder can sell any other variety with the same denomination or sell the protected variety with any other denomination," commitment of which is also a punishable act of infringement. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What are the objectives of the PPV&FR Act (2001) ?>, (i) Establishment of an effective system for protection of plant varieties, rights of farmers and plant breeders and to encourage development of new varieties of plants (ii) Recognize and protect the rights of the farmers in respect of their contribution made in conserving," improving and making available plant genetic resources for the development of new plant varieties (iii) Protect plant breeders’ rights to stimulate investment for research and development for the development of new plant varieties""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is a plant variety according to the PPV&FR Act (2001) ?>, The variety is defined as follows:- A group of plants together belonging to a known botanical species or subspecies which can be (i) defined by the expression of the characteristics resulting from a given genotype of the group of plants; (ii) distinguished from any other group of plants on the basis of difference in the expression of at least one of its characteristics; and (iii) considered as a unit with regard to its suitability for being propagated, which remains unchanged after such propagation, A plant variety includes propagating material of new variety, extant variety, transgenic variety," farmers’ variety and essentially derived variety (EDV).

Can a plant variety be protected under the Patent Act in India ?>, No," Plant variety cannot be protected under Patent Act in India""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is difference between Patent Act and PPV&FR Act ?>, Both Acts deal with the IPR of the inventor, The Patent Act of India does not accommodate protection of a pant variety through patenting of a plant or its components or parts, The PPVFRA not only protects a plant variety, it also protects the rights of plant breeders and farmers on plant varieties," The protection of a plant variety is granted in the form of registration. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Are applicants from outside India eligible to apply for registration of their variety under PPV & FR Act, 2001 ?>","Yes, the procedure for obtaining plant variety registration is same for Indian citizen and foreigners, However, foreign applicants must furnish their address though their representatives in India for service while applying for plant variety registration.

Who is a farmer according to the PPV & FR Act ?>, A farmer is any person who - (i) cultivates crops by cultivating the land himself; or (ii) cultivates crops by directly supervising the cultivation or land through any other person; or (iii) conserves and preserves, severally or jointly," with any person any wild species or traditional varieties or adds value to such wild species or traditional varieties through selection and identification of their useful properties""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is a Farmers’ Variety ?>,“Farmers’ variety” is a variety which - (i) has been traditionally cultivated (in cultivation prior to introduction of varieties from modern plant breeding interventions) and/or evolved by selection(s) made in existing traditional variety population by the farmers in their fields; or (ii) is a wild relative or land race or a variety about which the farmers possess the common (traditional) knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For registration of varieties under farmers’ variety category, which varieties qualify ?>","Varieties which are traditionally cultivated and evolved by the farmers in their fields by way of selection of variants naturally evolved in the field or varieties which are wild relatives or land race about which the farmers concerned possess common knowledge, In the case of traditional varieties or landraces being maintained by the community or village, the rights will be that of the entire community without restricting it to its being under cultivation for a period of 15 or 18 years in cultivation, as the case may be, However, in the case of selection of evolved variant in such traditional or land races, the period of common knowledge of existence of the variant selection with the individual farmer shall be acknowledged by restricting it to no more than 15 or 18 years, as the case may be for the purposes of registration under extant variety in common knowledge. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In which category is a new variety bred by a farmer is registered ?>, A variety developed or bred as a new variety by following breeding procedures by creating variability using other varieties or genetic stocks to be disclosed as being utilized as parents of the breeding material or for variability through other means for selection, shall be categorised as any other new variety bred by a breeder, under this Act, That means for all purposes and processes, such a variety will be treated in the same manner as any other breeder’s variety and will also be registered eventually as a new variety or extant variety, as the case may be following DUS testing procedures and formalities as required, Here," the farmer will be considered as a breeder without separating him from other breeders. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Does that mean a claim for a New variety by a plant breeder (not farmer) made as a selection in the traditional variety or landrace cannot be registered as a new variety ?>, Yes, Unless the breeder names the farmer or community as a co-developer or beneficiary with consent or there is evidence for having artificially created variability in a population derived from a traditional variety by any tools of plant breeding other than simple selection in a naturally cultivated traditional variety, such as hybridization, mutation breeding, backcross breeding, introgression, population improvement, hybrid, etc., followed by repeated progeny screening with selection, etc., in the subsequent generations, there is no possibility of registration of such a variety as new variety bred by a breeder, ignoring the role of the farmers’ in having traditionally conserved the variety, Farmers’ interest will always be protected and in such case, with the help of the local Panchayat and State Agricultural University officials," such varieties can be protected in the name of the community of farmers’ group by evidence of heritage. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can a farmer or farmers’ community directly file for registration of farmers’ variety with the Authority HQ or its branches ?>, No, A farmer or community of farmers shall have to submit their applications for registration of farmers’ varieties endorsed by their respective Panchayats through the State Agricultural Universities/ Crop based ICAR institutes or Krishi Vigyan Kendrain whose jurisdiction the Panchayat is located, for initiating the process of protection of farmers’ varieties, Crop specific breeder of SAU’s/ICAR Institutions shall certify the seed material for its purity and uniformity by growing it for one season either at farmers’ field or at the institute, Further," the application shall be counter signed and forwarded to Authority by Director of Research of SAU/Director or Principal Coordinators of ICAR Institutions before the onset of next season as described in protocol for receiving applications. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is a variety registered or proposed for registration as a farmer’s variety distinguishable from a modern variety bred by plant breeders including farmer as a plant breeder ?>, Yes, (i) A farmer’s variety is clearly distinguishable from a plant breeder’s variety by being more productive with advanced agronomic features such as dwarf, early maturity, adaptive physiological traits, resistant traits to diseases and pests, responsive to fertigation and irrigation, etc., whereas the typical farmer’s variety is either a landrace itself (claimed as community variety by the community) or a natural mutant identified in the landrace or traditional variety cultivated for a long period by farmers in the region, but with a difference in one or two traits from the known traits of the land race or traditional variety, (ii) Historically, a farmer’s variety or landrace can never match the productivity performance as well as trait expression variation of an advanced variety bred through plant breeding processes by a breeder (including farmer as plant breeder), But it will retain the traditional value present in the variety for which it is a local niche or is being cultivated for long periods as a tradition by the farmers in the region even though it is lower in productivity than the modern high yielding varieties bred by plant breeders, (iii) The above (ii) is the reason why in the case of typical farmer’s variety, DUS testing is not done nor testing is done for two years, but a single year testing is done as Grow Out Test for uniformity and purity of the population," after the same is assured by the technical inputs from the ICAR crop mandate institution in the region or State Agricultural University or other relevant public sector institutions where crop improvement/plant breeding activities are taken up.

Are farmers’ varieties exempted from payment of registration fees and DUS test fees ?>,Yes, Applications for varieties of farmers meeting the definition of farmers’ varieties are exempted from payment of all fees except annual fee in any of the processes involved in registering a farmer’s variety or any other proceeding conducted before the Authority or Registrar or Tribunal or High Court or Supreme Court under the Act.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What are Farmers’ rights ?>, Farmer’s Right (i) A farmer entitled to be considered as any plant breeder just like anyone from private or public sector, if he has bred a plant variety by involving a non-traditional variety (including land race) as one of the source parents or initial population for applying any plant breeding methodology or tool other than the selection of naturally existing variability (natural mutant) in a land race or a traditional variety being cultivated, In such a case, the farmer also shall be entitled for registration and other protection just as any other plant breeder, Farmer’s Right (ii) In the case of farmers’ variety, a farmer or farmers’ community is entitled to be considered for registration of the farmers’ variety under extant category even if such a traditional variety or landrace has been in cultivation for more than one year and has been in the common knowledge of the community since long period, The application for such a claim shall be different from that to be used for registering a new variety, The application for registration of a farmers’ variety shall contain a declaration as specified in clause(h) of sub-section (1) of section 18, Farmer’s Right (iii) A farmer who is engaged in the conservation of genetic resources of land races and wild relatives of economic plants and their improvement through selection and preservation shall be entitled to be considered for recognition and reward from the National Gene Fund provided such material has been used as donor of genes in varieties registrable under this Act, Farmer’s Right (iv) A farmer shall be deemed to be entitled to save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share or sell his farm produce including seed of a variety protected under this Act in the same manner as he was entitled before the coming into force of this Act, provided he does not sell branded seed of the protected variety, In the case of vegetative propagules such as cuttings, buds, suckers, etc., the farmer’s rights to produce, save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share or sell the propagules are applicable on such propagules only when these remain parts of normal farm produce where the crop is cultivated for the commercial harvest of the crop without resorting to any seed-material propagation protocols that distinguishes the farmer as seeding material producer farmer, Farmer’s Right(v) A farmer also has a right to claim for compensation from the authorised agent/licensee/registered breeder as the case may be, by writing with prima facie evidences to the Authority in Form PV-25, if the registered variety he had purchased from authorised/legitimate agent/licensee of the registered variety, is not performing or did not perform agronomically as claimed on the packaging of the seed, The procedures as described in the Act (Section 39 (2) and Rule 67shall be followed by the Competent Authority before a decision is made to award the compensation as due, However, the right for claim of compensation shall not be valid in the case of purchase of seed of a registered variety sold either by unauthorised seller(other than authorised," licensed or agent of the registered breeder) or by another farmer(including shared/exchanged seed/propagating material) as his farm produce under the farmers’ right under Sec 39(1)(iv) above. """
"Will a variety bred by a farmer as a plant breeder which is recognized by the PPV&FR Act, 2001 as one of the farmers’ rights, also to be considered as a “farmer’s variety” ?>","No, A variety bred by a farmer like any other plant breeder will not be considered as a farmer’s variety, because, in a variety bred by him, the farmer will have also created genetic variability by any means available such as creating cross, raising segregating population, etc., in new plant materials from existing varieties or genetic stock or germplasm he would have obtained from anywhere which he shall disclose, This is in contrast to a variety considered as a farmer’s variety, A farmer’s variety which is among the five farmer’s rights, is developed as a selection by the farmer in the course of his normal tradition of cultivation of a traditional crop variety or landrace, where a differently looking plant is selected from within that landrace or a traditional variety whose progeny he stabilizes over several generations till pure, after which the selected variety looks different for at least one character distinguishable from the original landrace or traditional variety, Though it is a selection, it will remain a traditional variety selection as it is expected to maintain most characters of the traditional source variety or landrace.

What are the circumstances of seed or seeding material sale by farmers can be treated as not within the farmers’ right under Section 39(1)(iv) to sell or share or exchange the seed ?>,1, When the seed or seeding material is sold in a branded manner 2, When the seed or seeding material is sold as a processed product that cannot be categorized as “his farm produce” Explanation: • If the seed or seeding material was produced under contract for a seed producer or a company, it ceases to be the farm produce of the farmer concerned, • The seed or seeding material shall not be considered as a farmer’s farm produce, if the variety is not grown in the field/orchard for normal grain/vegetable/fruit/flower production, But, is sold as seed/seeding material produced following seed/seeding material production protocols such as space planting, isolation, roguing, isolated special harvesting, processing, nursery for exclusive seedling multiplication or propagule production or controlled conditions such as net house/glasshouse/separate media/soil activity limited to propagule production only, etc, The propagules should not have been, a, multiplied separately as seeding materials under nursery or protected conditions different from normal farm production practiced for selling the produce as commercial consumer product in the market, or b, treated with growth regulators, hormones or chemicals for facilitating their use as seeding material only, other than normal field protection chemicals, or c, produced as seeding propagules under controlled environment conditions involving processing, growing media or, d, packaged as seeding materials for transport as propagules irrespective of brand imprinting on the packaging that indicates commercial packaging for multiplication purpose as seeding material which is different from farm produce for consumption by consumers, If any farmer adopts the above processes or means where special growing conditions or inputs not related to commercial farm produce of the crop, then he has no entitlement of the farmers’ rights on such propagules under Section 39(1)(iv)," but has to obtain authorisation from the registered breeder or his successor or his agent either as an authorised person or as a licensee.)""",,,,,,
What is a “branded seed” for the purpose of describing the farmers’ right to sell ?>, “Branded seed” in the case of varieties propagated through seeds, means any seed sold in a package or any other container and labelled in a manner indicating that it contains seed of a variety protected under this Act, Any action such as selling from a container such as a box or a sack/bag on which obvious marking (temporary or otherwise) that point towards the content being seed/seeding material of a registered variety amounts to branding, In the case of vegetatively propagated plant species, branded seed refers to the product organized as plant generating propagules that may be tied together or isolated into a group or bundled together or units of single or multiple propagules bound together or grouped together in a container or packed/wrapped together, etc.," each identifiable with tag/indicator/mark/descriptor representing the registered variety or such variety’s denomination""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Can a farmer who has used his own saved seed, or who has purchased or procured unbranded seed of a protected variety as a farm produce from another farmer seek compensation in case of poor performance of the crop raised from such seed ?>",No, The farmers’ right for compensation is available only in the case of the failure of a crop raised from branded seed of a registered variety planted within the validity period as mentioned on the packing during the period of protection when the said seed is purchased from an authorised/licensed seller/retailer of the Registered Breeder or his Successor / Assignee / Agent, Compensation cannot be claimed on any other unbranded seed form.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is it possible for the title holder of a protected variety to enforce his right in respect of harvested material by the farmer which may have originated from legally or illegally procured propagating material of a registered variety ?>, No, The registered breeder has no rights on the harvested product including the seed irrespective of the source of the seed or seeding material being authentic or not, provided it is part of normal farm produce without any specialized treatment for making the crop obviously targeted for seed or propagule production, In the case of the example on apples, the farmer cannot be prevented from selling the apples, However, since the apple of the specific features which typically represent registered variety can be produced only on the trees of the registered variety only, the farmer would have acquired it from an unauthorized seed producer, Under this presumption, the registered breeder can file a complaint with local authorities asking for details on the source of the trees mentioning his ownership and the right he has to file for infringement against the person/company who may have sold the registered propagules of the protected variety, if it was done without permission of the registered breeder or from authorized source, A farmer however, can claim innocence of being unaware of the protection or consequences of buying/selling propagules without authorization, But, it is to be understood that in such cases of high value products, the sale/purchase of propagules will be even more expensive with guaranteed quality as there would be heavy investment made at the time of establishing either an orchard by the farmer who would produce apples or nursery by the farmer who would produce grafted seedlings, the likelihood of the farmer getting the benefit of being innocent is not very high," The Registered Breeder will however need to carefully accumulate evidence on the matter related to source propagule to file for infringement as well as objection to claim of innocence by farmer.
